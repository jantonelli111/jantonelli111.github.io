I am an assistant professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Florida. I completed my PhD in Biostatistics at Harvard University, where I also completed three years of postdoctoral training. I have a broad interest in statistics, but most of my research has centered around causal inference, high-dimensional modeling, flexible Bayesian models, and spatial statistics. I have also applied my methodological research to a number of problems in both environmental health and criminology. I currently serve as an Associate Editor for Bayesian Analysis.
